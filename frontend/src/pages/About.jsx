              Campus Market was created by students, for students. We understand the challenges of
              college life â€“ expensive textbooks, tight budgets, and the need to constantly learn
              new skills.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-900 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Our platform connects students within the same campus community, making it easy to buy
              and sell textbooks at fair prices, and exchange knowledge through skill sharing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-900 leading-relaxed">
              Whether you're looking for last semester's chemistry textbook or want to learn guitar
              from a fellow student, Campus Market is here to help you succeed while building
              meaningful connections.
